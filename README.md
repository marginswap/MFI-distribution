# MFI Distribution
##MFI distribution and liquidity mining event
The Marginswap token distribution is designed from the get-go to drive the adoption of the marginswap protocol and apps building on it. Hence, the remainder of MFI tokens will be distributed to users and early adopters of Marginswap.

###Distribution of protocol incentive tokens: 2,500,0000 MFI
will be distributed starting at 4000 MFI daily, with a 0.1% daily contraction of that distribution amount.
These tokens will be distributed for 980 days, starting from 04.03.2021 with the last distribution happening on 08.11.2023. At that point, the protocol need not incentivize trading and bond lending, and also if there need to be any new forms of incentives, the treasury should be able to cover it.
The daily distribution will happen in 2 stages:
Before Beta: Before Beta, Uniswap liquidity providers for the MFI-USDC pair will receive all the daily token distribution.
After Beta: After the beta launch MFI daily distribution will be distributed as follows
Uniswap liquidity mining 20%
Bond lending 40%
Margin swaps 30%
Stakers 10%
Distribution of marketing, bounty, treasury: 1,000,000 MFI
200,000 of these tokens will be unlocked on 04/04/2021 and the rest of the tokens will be sent to a new vesting contract from which 100,000 MFI will be released every 60 days.
A good percentage of the 1,000,000 MFI will be reserved for incentivizing other features we have planned for marginswap.
